Politicians to Poop
=============

Chrome extension that replaces the names of major political candidates with the poop emoji (ðŸ’©).

Specifically, those running for the office of President of the United States of America in the 2016 cycle. 

Options allow you to poopify the names of Democrats, Republicans, or both. (Any major third-party candidates that emerge will also be added to the list.)

Please note that no judgement upon any of these individuals, nor their platforms, parties, or believes is implied or intended. We are offering an equal-opportunity text replacement tool, for the good of all humanity.

Possible reasons that you might want to use this extension might include:

* You are from outside the US, and don't need to hear these names every day.
* You are temporarily overloaded by the amount of poop that the candidates sling at one another
* For humor's sake.
