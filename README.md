Politicians to Poop
=============

Chrome extension that replaces the names of major political candidates with the poop emoji (ðŸ’©).

Specifically, those running for the office of President of the United States of America in the 2016 cycle. 

Options allow you to "poopify" the names of Democrats, Republicans, or both. (Any major third-party candidates that emerge will also be added to the list.) 



Installation
=============

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/oskay/politicians-to-poop/blob/master/pol-to-poo.crx?raw=true)

What about FireFox, Safari, Opera?
=============

Sorry, not yet. Pull requests and/or pointers to versions for those browsers will be happily accepted.



What is the political agenda here? 
=============

No particular agenda, sorry. This is a public service project from Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories. 

Possible reasons that you might want to use this extension might include:

* You are from outside the US, and don't need to hear these names every day.
* You are temporarily overloaded by the amount of poop that the candidates sling at one another.
* Because it is funny.


No judgement upon any of the named individuals, nor their platforms, parties, or beliefs is either implied or intended. This is an equal-opportunity text replacement tool, for the good of all humanity.



List of named participants
=============

The following individuals are currently identified as "major" political candidates, meeting the necessary criteria for inclusion in this list:

Republicans: Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, Rick Santorum, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki, Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee, Rick Perry, and Jeb Bush.

Democrats: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Lincoln Chafee, and Martin O'Malley.

Third-party and independent candidates: Roseanne Barr, Zoltan Istvan, Waka Flocka Flame, and Vermin Supreme. (While none of these yet seem "major" to our untrained eyes, it is good to have some names here as placeholders for future use.)



Known issues
=============

Text replacement does not reliably work in some circumstances, including on pages of Google search results. This seems to be an issue for other text replacement extensions of this sort as well. 

If you identify other circumstances where text replacement does not work reliably (or generates too many false positives), you are welcome to open an issue.
